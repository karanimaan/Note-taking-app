# QuickNote

QuickNote is a note taking app, made for efficient usability. For one, using the keyboard to navigate is faster than using the mouse. Also it should be stable and predictable; therefore it should be plain text (using markdown or org mode). At the same time, it should be compatible with traditional paradigms (like using the mouse).

## Features

- Notes can be made quickly (without a filename)
- It must be fully navigable with the keyboard
